Biggest problem:
how to label the data

try seveal way 
use dbscan to find cluster
use kmeans to restrict the cluster number
the result is terrible 

semi-supv ml
label spreading
random select 150 data point from each year each company
try to rate and label the data by our observation
then use the label spreading to learn and spreading the label to the rest data point
then fail again
most of the point have label A the best 

so we use smartmeter perc as the reference to label the data.
